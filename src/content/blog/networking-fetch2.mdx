## Introduction

Welcome to the first installment of my blog series aimed at demystifying the layers of abstraction surrounding internet and networking protocols.

If you're a mid-level backend or frontend software engineer, you're likely familiar with high-level concepts like making HTTP requests using the `fetch` API of the browser or Node.js.
However, have you ever wondered what happens beneath the surface when you initiate such a request?

In this series, we'll embark on a journey together, starting from the familiar realm of web development with `fetch` as our point of entry.
Our goal is to peel away the layers of abstraction one by one, delving deeper into the underlying technologies that power the internet.
The series will use Node.js as experimentation platform to illustrate the concepts.
So you'll likely learn about many of Node.js standard libraries.

In this first article, we'll focus on understanding the fundamental concepts of web communication.
Whether you're a seasoned developer or just beginning to explore the intricacies of networking, this series aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play.

So, grab your favorite beverage, fire up your code editor, and let's dive into the fascinating world of internet protocols, starting with `fetch`.

What you Need:

- Node.js >= v21.0.0 (Recommendation: Use the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) for managing Node.js versions)
- a code editor
- (later) a Linux machine for raw packet sending

What to Expect:

- A breakdown of how the browser interacts with web servers using HTTP.
- Exploring the `fetch` API and its role in making HTTP requests.
- Understanding the basics of HTTP and the request-response cycle.
- Practical examples and code snippets in Node.js to illustrate concepts.

By the end of this article, you'll be ready to peel away the next layer of abstraction in our journey through the depths of networking protocols.

## fetch

### Basic Usage

```js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite"
);

console.log("## Response Status");
console.log(`${response.status} ${response.statusText}\n`);

console.log("## Headers");
for (const header of response.headers.entries()) {
  console.log(header.join(": "));
}

console.log("## Body");
const body = await response.text();
console.log(body.slice(0, 1000));
```

- basic request/response
- response headers

- status code
- content
  - content-encoding: gzip
  - content-language: en
  - content-length: 54665
  - content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
- further download
  - accept-ranges: bytes
- browser cache
  - cache-control: private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0, must-revalidate
  - age: 26445

  - vary: Accept-Encoding,Cookie,Authorization
- cookies
  - set-cookie
- security
  - strict-transport-security: max-age=106384710; includeSubDomains; preload
- custom headers (x-)

- fetch compression is transparent
- `text()`: The response is always decoded using UTF-8.

### Experiments

- try using different HTTP methods (e.g. `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- try using invalid HTTP methods (e.g. `INVALID`, `ABCDE`)
- try using different `accept-encoding` headers
- does the order of the headers matter to wikipedia?
- send body data in a `GET` request

### Default Request Headers

- Node.js sets the `accept-encoding` header per default to `br, gzip, deflate`
- Node.js http server
- fetch Request + browser Request
- Response Headers

### Response Streaming

- timing of header response
- timing and length of chunks
- fetch has transparent decompression but not text decoding
- `util.TextDecoder`
