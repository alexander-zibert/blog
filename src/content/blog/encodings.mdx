## Snippet 1: ASCII Decoding

ASCII is the simplest well-known character encoding. A character encoding basically is a mapping between human readable characters and a single number, which can be interpreted by a computer. Let's explore ASCII with the following snippet.

<Snippet path="ascii-decoder.mjs" lang="js" />

### Questions

1. The ASCII encoding encodes characters as 7-Bit numbers. Look up a ASCII table and try to convert the bytes yourself. Run the code for verification.
1. Try to encode a simple string in ASCII and verify it by running the code.
1. Add some control characters to the byte array (e.g. `BEL` or `BS`). Be sure to run the script with Node.js in a real terminal.
1. In what number range does ASCII encode characters?
1. Try to add a few numbers outside the ASCII range to the bytes array. What do you expect to happen? What happens actually?

## Snippet 2: Simple ASCII Encoder

The method `.charCodeAt(i)` on a string gives you the unicode code unit of the character at index `i`. A unicode code unit is basically just a fancy word for a number which represents a character. Conveniently, unicode was standarized after ASCII and has the exact same character to number mapping as ASCII. We can use this fact to write a simple ASCII encoder.

<Snippet path="ascii-encoder.mjs" lang="js" />

### Questions

1. Read the snippet. What output do you expect?
1. Choose a string and encode it to ASCII with the function in the snippet. Test the function by using a `TextDecoder` to decode the `Uint8Array`.
1. Write a similiar encoder for the [ISO-8859-1 / latin1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) character encoding.

<details>
  <summary>Hint for 3</summary>
  Use the fact that the unicode Latin-1 Supplement block (code units 0080â€“00FF) and
  the ASCII part collectively corresponds to IANA Latin-1. [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script_in_Unicode)

## Snippet 3: ASCII Supersets

There are hundres of text encodings. Most of the well-known ones were specified after ASCII and as such try to support it for legacy reasons. But which ones are a proper superset of ASCII and can decode all ASCII encoded text?

<Snippet path="test-ascii-decoders.mjs" lang="js" />

### Questions

1. Which encodings in this snippet are a proper superset of ASCII? Which are mostly similiar but differ in a few characters?
1. What does the `escapeControl` function do and how does the regex work?
1. Is this an exhaustive test?
1. Adjust the test for the [ISO-8859-1 / latin1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) character encoding. Which WHATWG encodings are a superset of the latin1 encoding? Which encodings are mostly similiar?
1. Which ISO-8859 encodings were used for russian, which for turkish? Can any fixed-length single-byte character encoding be used to use Cyrillic and Turkish in the same text?
1. How many characters are frequently used in modern Japanese? Can any fixed-length single-byte character encoding be used for Japanese?
1. (optional) The web does not expose APIs for legacy single-byte character encodings. Implement one for each one specified in WHATWG. Use the encoding algorithm specified in [WHATWG](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#legacy-single-byte-encodings). The [WHATWG indexes.json](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/indexes.json) file will probably be helpful. Test exhaustively with the appropriate `TextDecoder`.
