## Introduction

In software testing, deciding whether to continue testing after
encountering a certain number of bugs can be challenging. However, a
method originating from ecology, known as [Mark and recapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_and_recapture),
can provide a more informed decision-making process.

This method involves employing two independent testing teams (or
individuals), each operating without communication. Both teams record the
bugs they find, and after a given time frame (e.g. two hours), they
compare the number of bugs they have in common. The assumption is that if
both teams have a significant overlap in the bugs they found, there may
not be many more bugs to discover. Conversely, if both teams found many
unique bugs, there is a higher probability that there are still many more
to be discovered.

## Considerations

- Ensure that both testing teams work independently in the same part of
  the system and refrain from making alterations to the system between
  tests.
- The resulting bug count from this widget is highly context-dependent. In
  some systems, having 100 remaining bugs may still be acceptable, while
  in others, aiming for under 3 is advisable.
- You can also choose to test only a part of the system (e.g., the
  purchase flow). By doing so, you will obtain an estimate of the
  remaining bugs specific to that particular part of the system.

- Initially I found this on the [interactive blog](https://observablehq.com/@troymagennis/latent-defect-estimation?collection=@troymagennis/agile-software-development) of Troy Megennis
- John D. Cook's [explanation](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/07/13/lincoln-index/) of the method is much clearer than mine
- This widget uses the [Chapman estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_and_recapture#Chapman_estimator)
