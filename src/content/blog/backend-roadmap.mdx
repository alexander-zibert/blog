## Learning

- [How to Properly learn from GameDev Tutorials!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YzSgHD49Mw)
- [PRIMM](https://static.teachcomputing.org/pedagogy/QR11-PRIMM.pdf?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org)
- CASMIR (found in "Learn More Python the hard way")
  - **Copy** the code and get it working like you normally do. Your copy should be exactly the same. This helps you get an understanding of it and forces you to study it closely.
  - **Annotate** the code with comments and write an analysis for all of the code, making sure you understand every line and what it does. This may involve jumping into other code youâ€™ve written to tie the whole concept together.
  - **Summarize** the general structure with succinct notes for what makes this code work. That would be a list of functions and what each function does.
  - **Memorize** this succinct description of the algorithm and key pieces of code.
  - **Implement** what you can from memory, and when you run out of details, go back to your notes and original code to memorize more.
  - **Repeat** this process as many times as you need to finally make a copy from memory. Your copy from memory does not have to be exactly the same but should be close and pass the same test you create.
