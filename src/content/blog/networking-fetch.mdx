## Intro: HTTP in the Browser

### Questions

1. What are the parts of the URL "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite"?
1. Open the network tab of your browser's devtools. Go to "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite". What do you see in the devtools?
1. Which ressources does your browser download for you? How many bytes are downloaded?
1. Which ressource is downloaded first?

## Snippet 1: Simple Fetch

<Snippet path="01-fetch.mjs" lang="js" />

### Questions

1. What is the hostname of the server, we communicate with?
1. Why do we need two awaits one for the `fetch` and the other for `response.text()`?
1. What does the response status signify? What other important response status are there?
1. Which request headers did we send?
1. How does the browser know, which file format the response is?
1. Why did we receive the `content-encoding: gzip` header? How can we receive a uncompressed version of the content? How does the `content-length` header change?
1. Why do we not need to decompress the content?
1. You just want to get the response headers? What happens if you modify the code so that we do not wait for the body? How can you improve this behavior?

### Ressources

The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) have one of the best descriptions of basic HTTP communication. Here are some interesting articles:

- [HTTP Overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
- [HTTP Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
- [HTTP Status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

## Snippet 2: Streaming Fetch

<Snippet path="02-streaming-fetch.mjs" lang="js" />

### Questions

1. What does a `for await...of` loop do?
1. How many bytes are in each chunk?
1. How long is each chunk?
1. Is the number and length of each chunk deterministic? (try a few times)
1. How long is the duration between receiving chunks? (use [process.hrtime.bigint()](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processhrtimebigint))
1. How long does receiving the whole body take?
1. Why does the number of chunks not change if you set the `accept-encoding` header to an empty string? (no gzip encoding)
1. How do the timings change if you receive an uncompressed response?
1. What is inside the chunks? Try to convert it to text. (use the Node.js [TextDecoder](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#class-utiltextdecoder) with the appropriate flags)
1. Why is it beneficial to have a chunked response?

## Snippet 3: node:https

<Snippet path="03-node-https.mjs" lang="js" />

### Questions

1. How does the `node:https` API differ from the `fetch` API?
1. What happens if you comment out the `request.end()` line?
1. How do you set request headers?
1. What is the HTTP version of this communication? Can you get the HTTP version with `fetch`?
1. Do the response headers differ from the `fetch` version?
1. Do the chunks or chunk timing differ from the `fetch` version?
1. Decode the chunks.
1. Set the `accept-encoding: gzip` header. What happens to the chunk sizes?
1. Try to utf-8 decode the gzip response. Why doesn't it work?

## Project 1: Implement a simple `fetch`

The goal of this project is to implement a simplified version of Node.js `fetch` with the `node:https` API.
