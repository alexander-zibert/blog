## Interlude UTF-8 Encoding

## Interlude gzip Compression

## Levels of Abstraction

- Browser (HTTP)
- Node.js global `fetch` with `.text()`
- Interlude 1: text encoding: ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16
  - Node.js global `fetch` with `body` stream and `node:stream` and `TextDecoder` (UTF-8) (HTTP)
- Interlude 2: text compression: gzip
  - Node.js `node:https` and `node:zlib` (HTTP)
- Node.js `node:tls` (TCP/TLS)
- Interlude 3: crypto
  - Node.js `node:net` and `node:crypto` (TCP)
- Interlude 4: DNS/UDP
  - Node.js `node:dns`
  - Node.js `node:dgram`
- Linux TUN device (IP)
- Linux TAP device (Ethernet)
